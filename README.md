Running this **QuantifiedSelf** Web Application requires the following Python libraries : 

1. Flask
2. flask_sqlalchemy
3. flask_restful
4. matplotlib (matplotlib.pyplot)
5. flask_security

**Required commands**

>pip install flask
>pip install flask_sqlalchemy
>pip install matplotlib
>pip install Flask-RESTful
>pip install Flask-Security

Once this is done, open the Python file in a Terminal/Command Line:

>python3 app.py

1. The database.sqlite3 file needs to be in the same directory as the app.py file, along with the templates and static folders.

2. The app.py file needs to be run, and then the URL 127.0.0.1:5000 (default Flask port) needs to be opened. 

==The application, at this point, will be up and running.==
